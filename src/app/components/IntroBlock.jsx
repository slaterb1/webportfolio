      <p className="inner-p">  Hi! I am a neurodiverse, trans nonbinary person, that has been working in computer science for over 10 years. Over that time I have held numerous titles spanning responsibilities from leading tech teams and Engineers, to implementing software and building repeatable infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP. I got my start in Data Science with a focus on data visualization to help reason and explain the information that is uncovered through AI and Machine Learning. I have always been passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge, which has led me to complete many self directed projects which can be seen in my Project Showcase below.</p>
      <p className="inner-p">  More recently, I started my own game company, Raindog Games, and have continued to pour love and energy into it as much as I can while working fulltime to support my disabled partner and our dogs. I have helped the community out with building better accessibility options into games and would like to continue on that journey. My 5 year plan is to further develop my skills in game design in a more professional setting to be able to work fulltime in that field. 10 year plan is working fulltime on Raindog Games. I have built and hosted many web applications in the past through work and personal projects and have heaps of data processing experience to bring to the table, which I believe will make me an incredible asset to any game design company.</p>
      <p>  If you would like to reach out to me, I prefer email and will get back to you in a short amount of time.</p>
